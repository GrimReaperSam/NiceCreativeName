\section*{Abstract}
For many growing or developed cities, justice for housing becomes a serious issue. Unaffordable house prices are a pain for the young generation. Moreover, real estate speculation and urban renewal sometimes worsen the situation. Our project takes Taipei as a case study, trying to discover the city's land use with the help of satellite imagery and data released by the government.

We collect urban renewal data, and analyze the change of surroundings before and after the renewal such as land price, and environmental factors. We also analyze the relationship between renewed areas and illegal rooftops - the assumption is that these illegal rooftops represent houses for rental.

In the end, we want to build a platform to allow users to explore the evolution of the city and the land use. The user can understand the advantages and disadvantages a renewal can bring by comparing its surrounding between different years. In the end, we want to have an interactive way to demonstrate the gentrification in the city, showing how it affects peopleâ€™s everyday lives.
